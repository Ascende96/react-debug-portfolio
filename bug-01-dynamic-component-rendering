#  Dynamic Component Rendering via `.map()` Broke Logic

##  Internship – Website Builder Project

### ❌ Problem
The site was meant to dynamically show only the components (sections) that the user filled out.

Initially, the team used `.map()` to loop through a list of sections and render components accordingly.  
They also tried using `useEffect` logic **inside that `.map()` loop**, which caused it to silently fail.

### 🚨 Core Issue
React hooks like `useEffect` **must not be used inside loops, conditions, or nested functions**.  
The dynamic map structure caused **state/logic breakdown**, especially during updates or re-renders.

# ✅ Fix – Refactored Rendering Logic

## 🔧 Solution
I refactored the rendering logic to **remove the `.map()`** and instead:
- Rendered all possible section components in a default template
- Added `if` conditions to **only show the components that had user data**

### ✨ Example:
```jsx
{userData.section1 && <Section1 data={userData.section1} />}
{userData.section2 && <Section2 data={userData.section2} />}
