# 🐞 Dynamic Component Rendering Bug

## ❌ Problem
The site was meant to dynamically show only the components the user filled out.  
Using `.map()` combined with `useEffect` inside the loop caused errors because hooks can’t be used inside loops.

## ✅ Fix
Removed the `.map()` and instead rendered all components by default.  
Used conditional rendering to show only components with user data:

```jsx
{user.section1 && <Section1 />}
{user.section2 && <Section2 />}
